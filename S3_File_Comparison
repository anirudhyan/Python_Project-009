This file is used to Validate the data in S3 buckets 
The output we are trying to get in the dictionary as the file path and the file count
dict1={'file_path':'file_count'}
dict{'file_path':'file_count'}

dict1={} # dictionary that has file path as keys and counts as values 
lis1=os.popen('aws s3 l3 <bucket name>/').read() # list that has all directories in it

cnt_dir=count no of dir in path
cnt_file=count no of file in path
# If file is there then insert the file path and file count in dictionary and remove the file from the lis1
li1.remove(flies) # remove files from list1
#clear list_files after noting in a dictionary
while cnt_dir>0:
    for i in lis1:
